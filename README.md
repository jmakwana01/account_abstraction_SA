# Account Abstraction on EVM Chains

This repository provides a basic implementation of account abstraction on EVM-compatible blockchains using Solidity. It includes Foundry scripts for deployment and testing, making it ideal for experimentation and learning with core account abstraction principles.

## Features
- Basic account abstraction in Solidity for flexible account management
- Minimal gas usage, focusing on simplicity and essential functionality
- Foundry-based deployment and testing for EVM compatibility



### Prerequisites
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed

### Installation & Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

2. **Build Contracts**:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

This setup provides the foundation for experimenting with account abstraction, enabling efficient and reproducible deployment on EVM networks.
